## Required components

&nbsp; | Name | Comment
-----|-------------|--------
1 | [PCB & Components](https://easyeda.com/speed/AC-speed-control-for-grinder) | Go to EasyEda project page and order both in couple of clicks. If you order PCB first, components second, then you will be able to join delivery and save some bucks.
2 | [0.96" IPS Display](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32861823719.html) |
3 | [Micro stepper motor](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32979960185.html) | Other motors will need rework of 3d-printed supports.
4 | [Gearbox 1:300+ with long shaft](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32987637967.html) | For max gear ratio select lowest speed.
5 | [Transparent heat shrink tube 20-22 mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32791427710.html) | Display mount
6 | [2-side soft scotch](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33042643312.html) | Display mount
6 | [22 AWG wire](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32854919883.html) | SMT stencil positioning & motor mount.
7 | [Heat shrink tube 40 mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32791427710.html) | Motor mount

Note. You are strongly advised to order SMT stencil for your PCB. That will
add ~ 8$ in total to your order - good price for convenience. On placing stencil
order at jlcpcb, select option "custom size", and define small one. Then stencil
will be compact and light, with small delivery cost. You need top layer only. If
you order SMT stencil, add this comment:

_"Please make stencil with my paste layer directly. Make sure 2 TP rounds 0.7mm
with X = 43.0 and X = 108.0 exist"_
